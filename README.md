# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I created to practice and improve my Python programming skills. Each project is contained in its own subdirectory with a separate README file that describes the project in more detail.

## Project List

Here is a list of the mini-projects included in this repository:

Project 1: converter

Project 2: facedetection

Project 3: selenium test

Project 4: work

Each project is designed to be self-contained and can be run independently of the others. They are all relatively simple, but each one demonstrates a different aspect of Python programming, such as control flow, functions, modules, and object-oriented programming.

## How to Use

To run any of these projects, simply navigate to the project directory and run the Python file associated with that project. Each project directory contains a README file that provides more detailed instructions on how to run and use that project.

## Contributions

I welcome any contributions to this repository! If you have an idea for a new mini-project or would like to suggest improvements to an existing project, please feel free to create a pull request.
